            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inside the Stunning Mansion in Ex Machina</h1><p>There are many stunning, otherworldly sights in Ex Machina, the science-fiction film directed by Alex Garland that features a robot so lifelike she's played by actress Alicia Vikander. But the most breathtaking sight of all may be the 100 percent real, available-for-a-night's-stay location where the film is set: the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/681669ff82d513a623869d49c9b8fe8ee3c88229.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke. But to decide how to treat him, they needed to know exactly how long his heart had been acting up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2540bffcfc76dfb2a5e2975d8809099dcd0b592c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
